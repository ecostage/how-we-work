# How we work

Welcome to tracersoft, this will guide you through our development process and give tips that you will need later.


######Things you need to know before start:

* We are a flat organization with very high standards
* We work mostly with Ruby on Rails apps, on Heroku infrastructure.
* Write nice code is mandatory, we follow this convention: http://github.com/tracersoft/guides
* You will work with a small team, usually 3 devs. Good communication and accept teammates opinions is mandatory.
* eXtreme Programming: http://www.desenvolvimentoagil.com.br/xp/
* Red, Green, Refactor: you must know or learn TDD.
* We have free fridays. Clients will test our features developed over the week in friday. But "free" not mean "do nothing", developers always have something to learn and open source or secundary projects to develop. Maybe this is the primary way to determine your performance.
