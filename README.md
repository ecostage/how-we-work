# How we work

Welcome to tracersoft, this content will guide you through our development process and give tips that you will need later.

#####Things you need to know before starting:

* We are a flat organization with very high standards
* We work mostly with **Ruby on Rails** apps, on **Heroku** infrastructure.
* Write **nice code is mandatory**, we follow this convention: http://github.com/tracersoft/guides
* You will work with a small team, usually 3 devs. So, you have to be good on communication and acceptable with feedbacks!
* Our methodology is based on eXtreme Programming and Scrum: http://www.desenvolvimentoagil.com.br/xp/
* Red, Green, Refactor: you must know or learn **TDD**.
* We have free fridays. Clients usually test features, which are developed over the week, on fridays. But "free" does not mean like a "lazy day", it is a day in which we can learn new things, develop side projects or contribute to open source projects.
* Our **daily meeting** is done between 10am and 12am (always GMT -2).
* Our day starts between 8am and 10am and ends between 5pm and 7pm. Remote people must be online between 10am and 5pm.

####Project planning
The project planning starts with a **design sprint** on which the team receives the requirements of a project, brake it in small stories and make decisions about the project. And at this moment, the design team creates mockups and a layout for approval. Usually the design team will be one step ahead of the development.

Next week start development following the week guide.
At the end of the project we do a **project retrospective meeting**

####Our week

On mondays we start with a **sprint planning meeting** that may last upto the end of the day. At the end of the meeting the team begins working in the designated stories. We develop the project on monday, tuesday, wednesday and thursday.
Thursdays are the deadline to merge pull requests and deployment.

On fridays, the client usually tests the features developed over the week while the team have a **sprint retrospective meeting**. The feedback of the client is discussed on the following sprint plannining and fixes may be planned on the next sprint.
