# How we work

Welcome to tracersoft, this content will guide you through our development process and give tips that you will need later.

#####Things you need to know before starting:

* We are a flat organization with very high standards
* We work mostly with Ruby on Rails apps, on Heroku infrastructure.
* Write nice code is mandatory, we follow this convention: http://github.com/tracersoft/guides
* You will work with a small team, usually 3 devs. So, you have to be good on communication and acceptable with feedbacks!
* Our methodology is based in eXtreme Programming and Scrum: http://www.desenvolvimentoagil.com.br/xp/
* Red, Green, Refactor: you must know or learn **TDD**.
* We have free fridays. Clients usually test features, which are developed over the week, on fridays. But "free" does not mean like a "lazy day", it is a day in which we can learn new things, develop side projects or contribute to open source projects.
* Our **daily meeting** is done between 10 and 12am
* Our day starts between 8am and 10am and ends upto between 5pm and 7pm. Remote people must be online between 10am and 5pm

####Project planning
The planning starts with a design sprint, when the team will receive what the clients wants and tranform into a backlog and stories, making descisions about the project. The design team will make mockups and a layout for approval.

Next week start development following the week guide.
At the end of the project we do a **project retrospective meeting**

####Our week

On mondays we start with a **sprint planning meeting** that may last upto the end of the day. At the end of the meeting the team begin working in the designateds stories. We will work developing the project in monday, tuesday, wednesday and thursday.
Thursday is the deadline to merge pull requests.

On fridays, the client will test the features developed over the week and the team will be at a **sprint retrospective meeting**. The feedback of the client will be discussed in the next sprint plannining and fixes may be inserted in the next sprint.
